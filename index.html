  <h1> // eithne's website // </h1>

  <p>  this is my personal website. it's under construction... but feel free to look around ^^</p>

  <img src="image-gallery/persistence_transparent.png" alt="hej<3" class="inline"/>
  <br>
  
  <h3> about me </h3>

  <p>hi! i'm eithne!</p>
  <p>i like coding, bugs, and walking around. if i could spend all of my time learning about things i would. </p>
  <p>i like to create art, videogames and pixel art mostly. it's all quite mediocre but i am still proud of some of it...</p>
  
  <h3> why am i making this? </h3>

  <p> it's the first day of 2026 and i'm been depressed as hell! </p>

  <p> i've spent so much time avoiding confronting my feelings and compartmentalizing for so long that i started feeling like nothing. hrt changed me and made me feel emotions for the first time in a while. in some ways i'm better off but other ways still a mess. </p>

  <p>i amn't sure what i want from this website. i hope it can help me stop my bedrot and lack of motivation to do things. i want to write my ideas down in a more centralized spot, get better at expressing myself, keep track of what i create, and archive stuff about my father. i want something a bit more tangible and permanent than occasionally having things popping into my mind.</p>

  <h3>i hope things workout</h3>
